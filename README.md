# multinet.js

Multinet.js is a online visualization framework for large, dynamic and multi-layered graphs developed by the
Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich. The front-end is based on [three.js](http://threejs.org/), while the back-end uses
igraph and Flask to deliver layout information to the front-end.
